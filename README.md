# An analysis of Pokémon statistics

## Project Summary
In this project, I analysed a public Pokémon dataset using **SQL** and visualised insights using **Tableau** to explore the contributing factors to a strong Pokémon.
I focused on stat distributions, type comparisons, legendary status, and generational trends.
This is a simple project to begin my journey into analytics and gain skills that can be developed upon.

## Key Questions
1. Which Pokémon types have the strongest stats on average?
2. Are Legendary Pokémon generally stronger than non-Legendary?
3. How does strength vary by generation?

## Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite)
- Tableau Public
- GitHub
- Notion (for portfolio)

## Key Insights
- Dragon-type Pokémon tend to have higher stats on average, with Bug-types having the lowest.
- Legendary Pokémon have higher average stats than non-Legendary, with more than 200 points difference.
- While the average stats generation-to-generation do not vary by much more than 20, generation 4 has the highest stats on average.
